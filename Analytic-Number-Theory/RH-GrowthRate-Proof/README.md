**Abstract:**  
We present a claimed proof that all nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function have real part 1/2. Our approach analyzes the energy landscape E(Ïƒ,t) = log|Î¾(Ïƒ+it)| after Gaussian smoothing with scale Ï„(t) = Î±/log|t|, where Î¾(s) is the completed zeta function. The argument establishes a fundamental growth rate contradiction: zeros on the critical line collectively generate an energy barrier of magnitude (log|t|)|Î”Ïƒ| for any horizontal displacement Î”Ïƒ from Ïƒ = 1/2, while a hypothetical off-line zero can produce only a local depression of magnitude O(log log|t|). Through multiscale analysis, we propagate local curvature bounds of order (log|t|)^{3/2} in âˆšÏ„-windows to obtain global barriers that no local perturbation can overcome. The method synthesizes subharmonic function theory, Riesz measures, and Jensen's formula with a carefully chosen smoothing scale that creates forcing conditions prohibiting off-line zeros for |t| sufficiently large. All constants are explicit and derive from classical estimates (Riemannâ€“von Mangoldt, Stirling, Jensen), with the finite range |t| < Tâ‚€ covered by existing computational verification. The proof employs only established analytic number theory machinery and avoids circularity by deriving all barrier estimates unconditionally, without assuming the Riemann Hypothesis.
