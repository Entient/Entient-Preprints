## Abstract
Three independent precision domains show unexplained secular drift after all known corrections:  
- Optical clocks (10⁻¹⁸ offsets)  
- Lunar laser ranging (recession anomaly)  
- Cosmological redshifts (5σ Hubble tension)  

We introduce κ ≈ (1.0 ± 0.2) × 10⁻¹⁰ yr⁻¹, which accounts for all three anomalies.  
Methods withheld (patent-pending), but empirical fits and falsifiable predictions are presented.
